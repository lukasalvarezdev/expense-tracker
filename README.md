# Learning python by Lukas Alvarez
These are my first baby steps in python, so if you're gonna judge my coding skills based on this, please don't. Go check my profile instead [here](https://github.com/lukasalvarezdev).

The repository is divided into small projects each of them made to practice different skills, the following list is ordered by time (older ones first) so the deeper in the list, the better the code.

## Project setup

First clone the repo
```sh
  git clone lukasalvarezdev/learning-python
```

Install all dependencies
```sh
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Projects
### Calculator app
A small CLI program that performs the 4 basic aritmethic operations (addition, subtraction, divison, multiplication)

**How it works**:
   
First run the program
```sh
  cd calculator
  python main.py 
```
Then you just have to follow the promt instructions.

**Limitations**:

- It only does operations in the order you put them. It will get fancier in the future.
